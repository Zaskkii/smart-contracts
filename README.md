## Smart Contracts Included

- **Token-ERC20.sol**: Implementation of a standard ERC-20 token contract to represent digital assets on the blockchain.
- **auction.sol**: Contract for a decentralised auction where participants can bid and win digital assets.
- **voting.sol**: Contract for voting systems where voters can securely and transparently cast votes.

## Use

### Deployment of Contracts

To deploy one of the smart contracts included in this repository on an Ethereum network, follow these steps:

1. Install a compatible Ethereum client such as Ganache or connect to a public Ethereum network.
2. Compile the smart contract using a Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the contract using tools such as Truffle or directly via a web client3.

## Tests

Unit tests for each smart contract are included in the `tests/` directory. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have an Ethereum development environment configured and connected.
2. Run the tests using a testing framework such as Truffle or using custom test scripts.
3. Verify that all tests pass successfully before deploying any contracts into production.
